For cards if we hover on cards then a butten will be display at the backside of the card but 
on mobile devices it is very hard to hover or sometimes not possible.

So to show them we simply dont hide backside but include backside as front side only.

But to identify if we can hover on it or not we can use hover media query.


Brower console options:

we can add devices types(to make it mobile touch or non touch) and also devices pixel ration(to test to load
different images baised on pixel ration or dpi(dotes per inch)) .
